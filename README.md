# Meditary 🧘

> A meditation tracking app built by a meditator, for meditators.

**Meditary was developed by a meditation practitioner who felt the need for an app like this. No login screens, no in-app purchases, no tracking — just the features that matter to support a good meditation practice.**

## 🎯 Philosophy

Meditary was built with a clear vision:

1. **Privacy First**: No accounts, no servers, no tracking. Your meditation practice is personal.
2. **Simplicity**: Only features that enhance your practice, nothing more.
3. **Offline Always**: Works perfectly without internet. Your data never leaves your device.
4. **No Monetization**: No ads, no subscriptions, no in-app purchases.
5. **Open Source**: Transparent, auditable, and community-driven.
